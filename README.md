# digital_advertising_analytics-
Python code from my digital advertising course

### My most impressive work on here is my final project: Google_Twitter_Poll_Data_Analysis.ipynb
I pulled data from social studio looking at Twitter mentions of different candidates in addition to Google Trends data aquired through the Google Trends API in an attempt to predict poll numbers aggregated from FiveThirtyEight.
